![Preview-Screens](https://github.com/Ana204/Clone_Netflix/blob/master/NetflixImg.png)


### `About this Project`
This project has as a first instance a personal training, for my portfolio. Building only the front with some features, thus making the page dynamic to be used by others curious.

### `Some Observations about this App`
1 - In this application I am consuming an API - (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), <br>
2 - The 'watch' and '+ My list' button just to illustrate the front, if clicked you will be redirected to the same page,<br>
3 - Movies are only to be listed in front of the application, <br>
4 - Image rights for netflix.<br>

###  `Functionalities`
1 - When reloading the page, a loading gif will appear, until the front is rendered on the screen -
(https://media.wired.com/photos/592744d3f3e2356fd800bf00/master/w_2000,c_limit/Netflix_LoadTime.gif), <br>
2 -When reloading a page, define a new movie suggestion for you, along with the genre, title, points, how many seasons, year the film was made or published and with a brief description, <br>
3 - The list of films contains a simple auto scroll to the left and right.<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
